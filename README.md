## Project 6
**Instructions**<br>
Create a program that simulates Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user will have to enter their choice, and the program will then determine if the user or the computer wins. The program should keep track of the statistics of the game and display the statistics once the game is over. The game should last for 10 rounds.
